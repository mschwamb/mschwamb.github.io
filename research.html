								<h1> Current Research</h1>
			
				 <p>My research covers a broad range of topics in planetary astronomy and planetary science including: </p>
					<ul> 
						<li> Probing the Solar System’s Small Body populations in particular focusing on the Kuiper belt and Inner Oort Cloud </li>
						<li> Utilizing crowdsourcing/citizen science to tackle big data challenges in planetary astronomy </li>
						<li> Studying the seasonal winds and atmosphere/surface interactions of Mars’ South Pole </li>
						<li> Exoplanet detection and population statistics</li>
					</ul>
							
			
					<h3> Preparing for Solar System Science with the Legacy Survey of Space and Time </h3>
					<p> Over its 10 year lifespan, the <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/"> Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)</a> will discover nearly 4 million Main Belt asteroids, almost
						~89,000 near-Earth Asteroids , ~32,000 Kuiper belt objects, tens of interstellar objects, ~1000 Centaurs, and ~10,000 comets. LSST will not only be a dicovery machine for Solar System small objects, it will image most of these bodies hundreds of times in multiple optical filters enabling 
						spare light curves/rotational variability estimates, measurements surface colors, and cometary activity/collision searches. With the <a href="http://www.lsstsssc.org">LSST Solar System Science Collaboration (SSSC)</a>, I have been helping to develop
						methods and tools to analyze  LSST data, as well as helping to ensure the planned survey strategy that will maxmize discovering moving 
						objects throughout the Solar System. With the LSST expcted to start in early 2026, my research will focus on mining this unprecented dataset. </p>

					<h3> Sorcha </h3>
						<p> The sea of planetesimals within the Solar System are the remanent building blocks left after the formation of the Solar System. Studying thse objects can serve as artifacts that give insight into the Solar System's formation and past evolution. 
                Our team set out to accurately predict how many new Solar System objects would be discovered during the LSST, when these small bodies would be found, and how many observations each one would receive throughout the duration of the survey. A detailed understanding of
							the numbers and kinds of Solar System objects that will be discovered at different points in the 10-year survey can help astronomers get ready for the LSST and better plan follow-up observations with other facilities. </b>
                We have spent the last five years building Sorcha, a powerful software tool that simulates the LSST. <p>
				
				</p>Sorcha predicts which of the objects in an input model (representing a population of Solar System planetoids with specified orbits, sizes, surface colors) should be "found" by the survey. Sorcha calculates the locations of the model orbits on-sky and figures out 
								which of the model objects land within the survey images and would be bright enough to be detected by the Rubin Observatory's data analysis pipelines and Solar System moving object search pipeline. Sorcha uses a database of where the Rubin Observatory 
								searched on the sky and the weather conditions during the LSST (or <a href="https://survey-strategy.lsst.io/baseline/index.html">currently a simulation </a> of where the survey pointed provided by Rubin Observatory), the properties of the LSST Camera, 
								and properties of Rubin Observatory's software pipelines to figures out which of the input model objects should be found the survey. 

                 </p>
                 <p>
                Sorcha is built to handle the massive scale of LSST data, crucially allowing astronomers to compare model Solar Systems to the one we live in. Thanks to Sorcha, astronomers can Sorcha can predict what the "found" by the LSST would have found if the model 
					 represents the Solar System and compare the results to what was actually found by the survey  In the future these simulated "surveys" can be compared to the real LSST. Using this technique, astronomers can adjust the input model parameters/distribution of model
					 population's properties until the discoveries in the simulated version of the LSST mates matches the real LSST discoveries. This technique is very powerful, enabling estimates of the total number of objects, distribution 
of orbits, sizes, rotational variability, and surface properties for any of the small body populations within the Solar System.
                 
                 
                 <p> 
                Sorcha is freely accessible to download and use. You can learn more about Sorcha <a href="https://sorcha.readthedocs.io">here</a>. I use Sorcha to predict what the LSST should discover and in the future plan to use Sorcha to help translate what the LSST small body discoveries can tell 
				 us about their parent populations.

					<h3> Layup </h3>

					<h3> Seasonal Processes on the Martian South Polar Region </h3>
					    <p> Mars' south pole is sculpted by the never-ending cycle of freezing and thawing of exposed carbon dioxide ice. In the summer, carbon dioxide jets loft dust 
						and dirt through cracks in the thawing carbon dioxide ice sheet to the surface where winds blow the material into the hundreds of thousands of dark fans observed from orbit. Understanding the direction, frequency, and appearance of these fans (a proxy for the jets) and how varying factors impact these properties, we can better understand the Martian climate and winds. 
						Computers just aren’t good enough to do the required task, but the fans spotted for orbit are easily spotted by the human eye.
						The <a href="http://www.planetfour.org">Planet Four</a> and  <a href="http://terrains.planetfour.org">Planet Four: Terrains</a> projects are on-going online citizne science proejects collaborating with over 150,000 people around the world. Volunteers map the dark seasonal fans and other surface features 
						carved during by the carbon dioxide gas jets. </p>
